This service is designed to monitor, record, and transcribe voice activities across both Telegram and
Discord platforms. It tracks user presence and activities in Discord, records voice data of selected users, and forwards
it to a
designated Telegram channel for storage and transcription. Additionally, it sends Discord status messages to the main
Telegram chat.
